                                                 According to my own consciousness and its expressions based on my experiences,
                                                  I believe that an educated person is one who is able to adapt to his situations as per
                                                   the necessity of the hour. He should be able to utilize his skills and his education to overcome 
                                                   difficult obstacles in any area of his life so that he can take the correct decision at that moment.
                                                  That is what I believe make a person educated.
